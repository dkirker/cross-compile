This is a work in progress, don't touch it for
now. In fact compiling takes about 1 complete
day (at least here).

In case of questions as me:

Boost build fails for the moment. However in
the boost build dir just do "make copy" after
the failed build, it installs the boost headers
which is sufficient for gnash to build because
boost almost consists of header files (containing
cxx classes)

Using ffmpeg as media decoding backend for now,
see ../ffmpeg/. It builds but doesn't execute
on the palm actually, but we can ignore this as
gnash only uses it's headers/libs which are indeed
working on the palm, so...

Agg2 is the drawing backend, this seemed to be
the only option as others required either x11
or opengl- which are both not available.

I use Framebuffer as scren output backend. There
is sdl support too, which itself depends on opengl,
so I'll try to go with fb.
For framebuffer keyboardmapping, see it's README file -
not touched yet. But will be difficult because
there is no virtual mapping support in fb.cpp, see
the comment in the mentioned function by the authors.

Should execute swf7 well, most 8, some 9, no 10.
Supports touchscreens (see framebuffer README too)
