***** fb_input FB GUI input devices

The framebuffer GUI supports various input devices through the modern
Linux Input Subsystem (/dev/input/event*). Both standard mice and 
touchscreen devices are supported.

Make sure the USE_INPUT_EVENTS macro is defined in fbsup.h so that
the events system is enabled for the FB GUI (this may be configurable
at runtime sometime).

Since there can be multiple input devices in /dev/input/ you have to
specify which device to use using the 
 POINTING_DEVICE environment variable for the mouse and
 KEYBOARD_DEVICE environment variable for the keyboard
   

***** fb_calibration FB GUI Touchscreen Calibration

The touchscreen drivers (like "usbtouchscreen") provide raw data from the
devices. It is up to the user space program to translate this data to
screen coordinates. Normally this is done by the X server so this 
conversion needs to be done internally by Gnash itself.

The current implementation uses a very simple 2-point calibration where
the first point is at one fifth of the screen width and height and the
second point is at the exact opposite part of the screen (at it's lower
right). The SWF file calibrate.swf provides a simple graphical reference
for 4:3 sized screens (don't use it for other formats!).

With the current preliminary implementation it's a bit uncomfortable to do 
the calibration:

1) starting gnash with DUMP_RAW environment variable will show raw 
   coordinates on STDOUT:
     DUMP_RAW=1 gnash calibrate.swf

2) Keep touching the upper left reference point for a while. You'll get
   lots of (similar) coordinates printed. Choose a X/Y coordinate pair you 
   think is the best one (ie. the average) and write it down.

3) Do the same for the lower right reference point.

From now on, start gnash with the TSCALIB enivronment variable set to
the coordinates you just found out. Write the coordinates separated by
commas (X,Y,X,Y), like this: 
  TSCALIB=491,1635,1581,639 gnash yourmovie.swf
